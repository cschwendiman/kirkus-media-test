Intimidating Pluto remains in your Image House throughout 2016, giving you a decided edge on the competition. It should be easy for you to exude an air of calm control, even when you're feeling uncertain. If you want to win someone's heart, play the aggressor. When you ask for a date, propose a specific outing. Being prepared will make a terrific impression on the right person. Are you looking for work?

Dress for the job you want, not for the one you have. When you talk, think and behave like an accomplished person, success will find you. You may see some interesting career activity this year. On March 23rd, a Lunar Eclipse could see the sudden departure of an authority figure. You might be asked to replace this official, but be careful. This position could be more trouble than it is worth.

Another Lunar Eclipse on August 18th suggests that your company may experience financial difficulty. Fortunately, your job prospects will dramatically improve after September 10th. That's when expansive Jupiter will enter your Career Sector. Not only should it be easier to find your dream job, but you'll also be appreciated by the people who hire you. Saturn, your ruling planet, will be touring your Mystical Sector throughout 2016. This will give you an opportunity to review what is truly important in your life. Having more time for spiritual pursuits, uplifting relationships and meaningful work will take precedence over wealth and status.
