2016 is a time to wrap up loose ends. For the first eight months of the year, your friends will be encouraging you to leave a destructive situation behind. That's when benevolent Jupiter will be moving through your Friendship Sector. Lean on your nearest and dearest for support between January 1st and September 9th. With their support, you could summon the strength to end a job, relationship or habit that is no longer working for you. By September 10th, you'll feel much better about your life and take some time to cultivate your spiritual side.

Jupiter will be moving through your Mystical Sector. Being able to transcend mundane problems will be an enriching experience. The last four months of the year may not be terribly volatile, but they will be rewarding. It's entirely possible you will be turning your back on an unrewarding job. A Lunar Eclipse in your Career Sector on August 18th suggestions you may pull the plug on a professional position that is no longer working for you. Instead of being consumed by fear, you'll feel instantly gratified you put your happiness before a paycheck.

Finances may be a bit tight throughout the year, due to restrictive Saturn's journey through your Earned Income Sector. Fortunately, you're very resourceful and know how to thrive on a budget. Have faith in yourself and you'll make the most of this character building year.
