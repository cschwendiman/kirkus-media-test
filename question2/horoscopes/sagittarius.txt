Sober Saturn will be moving through your Image Sector throughout 2016. Your naturally ebullient personality could be a bit subdued, thanks to additional responsibilities being imposed on you. Instead of running from these challenges, rise to them. You'll gain the respect of both your peers and superiors by putting childish things away and assuming adult duties. A series of eclipses throughout the year will invite you to move out of your comfort zone. A Solar Eclipse on March 8th could prompt you to relocate to an area that is much more suited to your lifestyle.

If you don't own your place, you'll have a great opportunity to buy one. A generous relative or good bank loan can turn this dream into reality. On September 1st, a Solar Eclipse may trigger a career opportunity. Be aware this job will place great demands on your time. Although this position will be prestigious, it won't leave much opportunity for fun and games. Two weeks later, a Lunar Eclipse on September 16th could find you ending an emotional family matter that's draining your energy.

Stand up for yourself. Fortunately, expansive Jupiter will be helping you to achieve professional success. You should double your efforts at work between January 1st and September 9th. That's when you might reach heights you never dreamed possible. On September 10th, Jupiter will move into your Friendship Sector, giving you much needed support from your nearest and dearest.
