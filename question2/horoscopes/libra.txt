Recently, you've been working behind the scenes quite diligently. Although you're a social butterfly by nature, you'll continue to maintain a low profile for the first eight months of the year. Your love of solitude can be attributed to Jupiter's tour of your Privacy Sector. Instead of rubbing elbows with a wide array of people, you'll spend as much time as possible in seclusion. It will be a wonderful time for spiritually uplifting pursuits. Developing creative projects, communing with nature and connecting with your higher power can be very rewarding from January through September.

Pay careful attention to the days surrounding March 23rd. That's when a Lunar Eclipse will fall in your Image Sector. You may decide to abandon a lifestyle that no longer suits your needs. It's possible you'll abandon a stylish look for one that is simpler and easier to maintain. You might even change your name or present yourself as a different person from the past. Once September 9th arrives, expansive Jupiter will move into your Image Sector, allowing you to make a dramatic entrance into the spotlight.

People will be highly receptive to the new you. You'll become more outgoing and will resume your lively social life. It will be a great time to launch a business, go on auditions and play the dating game. This joyous trend will continue through next year soenjoy it!
