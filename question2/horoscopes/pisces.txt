You could undergo a dramatic transformation this year, thanks to two eclipses that fall in Pisces. The first happens on March 8th, when a Solar Eclipse prompts you to change your appearance in some way. Whether you change your hairstyle, revamp your wardrobe, undergo a fitness regimen or get a cosmetic procedure is immaterial. The important thing is to alter your outward appearance to match your personality. Implementing changes in early March will be empowering. Six months later, on September 16th, a Lunar Eclipse will occur in Pisces, causing you to dispense with a role that no longer suits you.

Leaving a job that bothers your conscience is a distinct possibility. Embarking on a more rewarding profession is a distinct possibility, thanks to serious Saturn's journey through your Career Sector. Although it may be necessary to accept a low-level position as a means to gain experience, you'll be much happier with this change of pace. Opportunities involving travel, education and publishing are highly favored. If you'd like to work overseas, learning a foreign language will dramatically improve your job prospects. Whatever your plans, you will get tremendous support from your best friend, romantic partner or business associate.

That's because benevolent Jupiter will be touring your Relationship Sector between January 1st and September 9th. You can rely on your nearest and dearest to offer help in all forms during the first eight months of the year. On September 10th, Jupiter will move into your Intimacy Sector. A close relationship could heat up during the last four months of the year.
