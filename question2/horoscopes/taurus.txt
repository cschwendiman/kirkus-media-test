Be alert during the weeks between April 29th and May 22nd, when Mercury, the planet of communication, moves through your Sun Sign. You might decide to alter your appearance in some way, upgrading your wardrobe or getting a new hairstyle. Keep your receipts and don't do anything too radical, as it's easy to change your mind under this transit. Still, this is a nice opportunity to challenge your assumptions about how you should lead your life. Jupiter, the planet of good fortune, continues to travel through your Romance and Creativity Sector until September 9th. Take this opportunity to develop your artistic talent.

If you've ever wanted to sell your handiwork, set your sights on this prolific period to do so. Adopting or conceiving a child is also possible under this transit, as is getting engaged or married. Once Jupiter moves into gracious Libra on September 10th, your good fortune will shift to health matters. Getting in shape, losing weight, recovering from an illness or getting treatment for a medical condition are among the possibilities. Pluto, the planet of transformation, will be touring your Personal Expansion Sector. If you want to change your life, you can do it through travel, study or spiritual exploration.

Writing can also have a profound effect on you. Becoming a novelist, screenwriter or playwright is entirely possible under this transit. Knowledge is power throughout 2016.
