2016 could be a tremendously lucrative year for you. That's because benevolent Jupiter will be touring your Earned Income Sector between January 1st and September 9th. There's a strong possibility you will land a job with a big salary. Getting a raise is another possibility. Selling an invention, book or song are other possibilities. A creative person like you, Leo, has tremendous potential for becoming wealthy through the fruits of your labor.

By giving your talent the time and attention it deserves, you can emerge from this year with a much bigger bank account. Saturn, the planet of commitment, will be moving through your Knowledge Sector throughout the year. Any endeavors involving personal expansion are strongly favored. Traveling, studying and writing can both improve your financial standing and provide spiritual fulfillment. Take every opportunity to venture out of your comfort zone in 2016. You will gain a deeper appreciation of the world and learn some surprising things about yourself.

A Lunar Eclipse on August 18th could mark an interesting turning point in a close relationship. That's when your best friend, romantic partner or business associate could get a sudden opportunity to study abroad. This will require you both to make some changes to your relationship, but this shift will be beneficial if you keep fear and jealousy at bay. Encourage your nearest and dearest to take chances and realize their potential. You may be repaid tenfold.
