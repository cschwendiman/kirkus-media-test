2016 invites you to keep your feet on the ground and think in terms of what is practical. That can be quite a challenge for you, Aquarius, since you are a born visionary. However, it's important to have a strong financial foundation from which to launch your ideas. Fortunately, generous Jupiter will be touring your Shared Resources Sector between January 1st and September 9th. Take this opportunity to apply for grants, loans and scholarships. You could receive a nice windfall from a wealthy foundation, easing the economic burdens of daily life.

On August 18th, a Lunar Eclipse will fall in your Image Sector, allowing you to embark on a more rewarding lifestyle. Keeping up with the Joneses may no longer seem important after this fateful date. Instead of working around the clock to pay the bills, you might choose to pursue a less demanding job. This new position could give you more time for the activities you really love. You might also be able to dress more simply and forgo expensive salon treatments. Intellectual pursuits will continue to bring you lots of pleasure.

That's because Uranus, your ruling planet, is continuing its tour of your Cerebral Sector. A writing project, challenging course or research job will be a source of tremendous highs and lows. Stick with this endeavor, because it's taking you to a higher level of success. You're sure to meet some influential people who can promote your work this year. Your impressive social circle comes courtesy of ambitious Saturn, which is moving through your Friendship Sector throughout 2016.
