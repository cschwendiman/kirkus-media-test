2016 may be a time of major transitions for you. Three eclipses are especially important to note. On March 8th, a Solar Eclipse in your Career Sector marks an exciting job opportunity. Make sure to apply for a position that sounds ideal, even if you think you lack the necessary experience. This could be your chance to land your dream job. On September 1st, a Solar Eclipse in your Domestic Sector could prompt you to make some changes to accommodate a relative; it might be necessary to relocate or rearrange your home.

Two weeks later, on September 16th, a Lunar Eclipse in your Career Sector might prompt you to change your professional priorities, cutting back on work in favor of more time with your nearest and dearest. Mercury, your ruling planet, will go retrograde in your Domestic Sector between August 31st and September 22nd. This will be a good time to reconsider the best living arrangement for you and your family. If you live alone, you may decide to combine households with a roommate to save money. Do you share the rent with a group of people?

It's possible you'll find your own place. If you own your house, it may be necessary to renovate or update a room. Be flexible and think in terms of what arrangement will serve you and your family best.
