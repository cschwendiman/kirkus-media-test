Beneficial Jupiter will be touring your Health and Well-being Sector until September 9th. This is an opportune time to get in shape, undergo a surgical procedure or recover from an illness. Follow your doctor's instructions to the letter or you won't get the full benefit of their expertise. There's a chance you'll have to alter your diet or rearrange your schedule to feel better. Although you'd rather do things the old way, you'll feel so much better when you make these few simple adjustments. Give yourself time to be uncomfortable while you undergo this transition.

After September 9th, you'll enjoy a surge of luck in the relationship department, thanks to Jupiter's entry to Libra. If you're single, you may meet someone special at a religious, cultural or educational gathering. Keep your eyes open for someone with gentle coloring who dresses well.. The potential for a lifetime of happiness is strong. If you already have a partner, this would be a wonderful time to renew your commitment to each other. Taking a romantic vacation or spending more time together is strongly advised.

You'll remain creative, vibrant and original throughout 2016, thanks to unique Uranus's tour of your Personal Sector. Don't bother to blend in with the crowd. You'll fare much better by proposing unusual ideas, breaking new ground and challenging the status quo. Pluto's tour of your Career Sector will trigger some standoffs with authority figures, but you'll be able to win them over, provided you are respectful.
